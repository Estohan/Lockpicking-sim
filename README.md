# Lockpicking-sim

## Description

* A simple 3D lockpicking simulator, designed as a minigame that can be inserted as part of a larger
video game. It visually resembles lockpicking minigames like the ones present in [TES V: Skyrim](https://news.softpedia.com/images/extra/GAMES2/large/TESV/TESVtxtscr_007-large.jpg) or
[Fallout](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2015/usgamer/f4_lock_02.jpg), but intends to add a bit more realism by trying to mimic the actions of binding and setting
the pins of a pin-tumbler lock. These actions will have audio cues associated with them and
(optionally) visual illustrations of pin states.

## Demo

* This project is currently in development; a demo will be added here later.
